# Tom's Mute Manager
A very simple script that helps users mute another player locally.

That's literally it, it does come with a menu though... no skinning included.

## Chat Commands
**/mute {playername}** - Mutes the specified player locally
**/unmute {playername}** - Unmutes the specified player locally
**/mutemanager** - Opens the mute manager menu

*Both /mute and /unmute will also open the menu if you do not specifiy a player's name.*

## Console Commands
**mute_manager** - Opens the mute manager menu
**toms_mute_manager** - Opens the mute manager menu

## Configuration
Mute manager comes with a **very** small config, there are two tables for you to change.
The first table allows you to define which usergroups cannot be muted by other players.
The second table allows you to define which usergroups cannot mute players.

Both of these are very useful options to have as you don't want people blocking your staff members' voice chats. You also wouldn't want the staff to forget that they've blocked the voice chat of a player they're dealing with.
